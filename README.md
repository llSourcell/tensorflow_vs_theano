# tensorflow_vs_theano

##Overview

TensorFlow vs Theano code by @Sirajology on Youtube. This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/MDP9FfsNx60) video. There are two scripts here. Both scripts do the same thing, they generate some dummy data then find the line of best fit for it in both Theano and Tensorflow. The purpose of this repo is to compare the syntax and architecture of both frameworks. You'll find a more detailed comparison in [this](https://medium.com/@sentimentron/faceoff-theano-vs-tensorflow-e25648c31800#.bg4xmz1au) article.

##Dependencies

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)

## Usage

Just run both scripts like so once you've installed the dependencies

```
python tensorflow_demo.py
```

```
python theano_demo.py
```

##Credits

The credits for this code go to the guy who wrote [this](https://medium.com/@sentimentron/faceoff-theano-vs-tensorflow-e25648c31800#.bg4xmz1au) article. I've merely wrapped it.
